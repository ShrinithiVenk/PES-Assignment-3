# PES-Assignment-3
The assignment contains a program that involves blinking red, green, blue, and white LEDs with certain (specified) delays. A capacitive touch sensor has also been used to make a specific pattern (color) of LEDs. Programing Environment: MCUXpresso IDE with KL25Z128VLK4 board SDK is used for programing. Apart from the files that IDE uses for building a project, Blinkled.c contains the primary code for the project. The Code: There are, in total, three .c files (blinkled.c, touch.c) and two .h files (touch.h, blinkled.h)

Peer Code Review comments:
1. Delay timing can be included in the delay function to improve code readability. 
2. Introduce polling time.
3. Intendation can be checked and corrected to improve code readability.
